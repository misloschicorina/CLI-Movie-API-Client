# TEMA 3 - PCOM â€“ Command-Line Client for REST API

## Overview

This C project implements a **command-line client (CLI)** that interacts with a RESTful server using HTTP. The application allows users to authenticate as **admin** or **user**, and perform operations related to user management, movies, and collections of movies.

The client communicates with a real backend server:
- **HOST:** `63.32.125.183`
- **PORT:** `8081`

## Features

The application supports the following features:

- Admin and user login/logout
- JWT-based access to a movie library
- Full management of users (admin only): add, list, delete
- Full management of movies: add, view, update, delete
- Management of collections: create, update, delete, add/remove movies

## File Structure

### Command Handlers

- `commands/commands.c/h`: dispatch logic for commands
- `commands/admin_commands.c/h`: admin functionality (user management)
- `commands/user_commands.c/h`: user login and session handling
- `commands/movie_commands.c/h`: movie CRUD operations
- `commands/collection_commands.c/h`: collection CRUD operations

### Core & Helpers

- `client.c`: CLI main loop, calls `process_command`
- `helpers.c/h`: utility functions for input/response handling
- `http_requests.c/h`: builds HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- `state.c/h`: manages session state (cookies, tokens, flags)

### JSON Support

- `parson.c/h`: Lightweight and easy-to-use JSON parser for C, used to decode all API responses and extract structured data such as tokens, error messages, and resource details (e.g., movies, collections).
- Parson was chosen for its simplicity, minimal overhead, and portability. It consists of a single `.c/.h` file, has a permissive license, and integrates easily into C projects without requiring external dependencies.
- It supports both JSON objects and arrays and allows safe, type-checked access to fields.
- The library is included locally in the project.
